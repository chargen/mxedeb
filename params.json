{"name":"MXE - build-pkg","tagline":"Binary distribution of MXE packages","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nMXE (M cross environment) is a Makefile that compiles a cross compiler and cross compiles many free libraries such as SDL and Qt. Thus, it provides a nice cross compiling environment for various target platforms. Visit [MXE site][mxe] to learn more about MXE.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to provide binary packages built from MXE packages. Packages can be downloaded as `tar.xz` files or installed as Debian packages from our APT.\r\n\r\n### tar.xz packages\r\n\r\n`tar.xz` packages can be downloaded from the following location:\r\n\r\nhttp://mxe.redjohn.tk/repos/tar/\r\n\r\n### Debian packages\r\n\r\nTo install Debian packages, add the location of our APT to your `/etc/apt/sources`:\r\n```\r\n# echo \"deb http://mxedeb.redjohn.tk/repos/apt/debian wheezy main\" > \\\r\n   /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mxeapt.list\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen add our GPG key to APT:\r\n```\r\n# wget -O - http://mxe.redjohn.tk/repos/apt/conf/mxeapt.gpg | apt-key add -\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpdate APT cache:\r\n```\r\n# apt-get update\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall some MXE package:\r\n```\r\n# apt-get install mxe-i686-w64-mingw32.static-qt\r\n```\r\n\r\nNames of packages are `mxe-<target>-<package>`.\r\n\r\nPossible targets:\r\n\r\n * i686-w64-mingw32.static\r\n * x86-64-w64-mingw32.static (note that `_` replaced with `-`)\r\n * i686-w64-mingw32.shared\r\n * x86-64-w64-mingw32.shared (note that `_` replaced with `-`)\r\n\r\n### How to build packages\r\n\r\n 1. Install lua, tsort, fakeroot, dpkg-deb\r\n 1. Clone `mxe` to local directory.\r\n 1. `lua tools/build-pkg.lua`\r\n 1. Packages are written to `*.tar.xz` files.\r\n 1. Debian packages are written to `*.deb` files.\r\n\r\nTo convert a set of `.deb` files to an APT, you can [use reprepro][reprepro]\r\n\r\n[mxe]: http://mxe.cc/\r\n[reprepro]: https://wiki.debian.org/SettingUpSignedAptRepositoryWithReprepro","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
